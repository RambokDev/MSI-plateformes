Introduction
============


Following the legacy of the clearance project proposed by a partnair company. Icam wishes to develop its robotics center in order to demonstrate its ability to present POCs (proofs of concept) with the aim of reaching industrial robotics professionals.

Today, our Cobot is not designed for industrial clearance, due to its physical limitations, so we will exclude the speed performance criterion. Thus, we will remain within the framework of the development of a POC. This therefore allows us to adopt a general vision of the robotic platform by having the possibility of removing several types of objects ranging from sanding, packaging or even removal. In this way, we will be able to highlight the flexibility of the system.




Description
**********

``MSI-plateforme`` is a software for centralizing the commands of a robotic platform under ROS. You will find different parts, such as UR10e and Fanuc robot controls, but also the control of external elements (grippers, lights, cameras, etc.)
